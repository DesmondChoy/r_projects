<h1>Singapore General Elections 2020</h1>
<p>With <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ge-2020-singapore-parliament-dissolved-paving-way-for-general-election-081602263.html">election fever</a> heating up, political parties have been releasing their manifestos to share campaign promises and educate the uninitiated on how policies <em>should</em> be made. With all 93 elected seats in Parliament organised into 14 Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) and 17 Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) being contested by 11 political parties, I wanted to create an interactive data table that consolidated all manifestos and would make it convenient for voters to compare policies and issues across different parties.</p>

<li>RP’s manifesto is the shortest by far, with no social media links, no introduction, and just one image of its party logo.</li>
<li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Rn0NnGUXWeJXcjcyoa0UDDOmfCLu8Pn/view">SDA’s manifesto</a> comprised of only images and figuring how to convert images to text accurately could be a herculean task, so I opted for <a href="https://www.onlinecitizenasia.com/2020/06/30/singapore-democratic-alliance-issues-elections-manifesto-ahead-of-pasir-ris-punggol-grc-contest/">a summary of their manifesto</a> from The Online Citizen instead.</li>

<p>PAP, PSP and RDU’s manifestos requires more data wrangling because of the column formatting and bullet points in it. We can’t use <code>pdf_text()</code> as we did above because it doesn’t seem to extract bullet points well, but <code>pdf_data()</code> does a good job at it. The caveat is, we don’t get a clean one-page-a-row format as we do with <code>pdf_text()</code>, so we have to run <code>unnest_tokens()</code> twice (intuition detailed in code). More details on <code>unnest_tokens()</code> can be found in my previous <a href="https://desmondchoy.netlify.app/2020/05/hip-hop-lyrics-be-flowin-with-tidy-text-mining/">blog post</a>)</p>

<p>Consolidating SDP’s manifesto required significant subjectivity and discretion. It seems the only way to obtain a consolidated manifesto is to pay $42 for a <a href="https://yoursdp.org/store/the-way-forward">hardcopy book</a>.</p>
<p>So I resorted to visiting to <a href="https://yoursdp.org/policies">their website</a>, saving each of those 10 pages as PDFs, and combining them. I also note a lot of their pages are rather dated and written over a year ago.</p>

<h2>Manifesto United</h2>
<p>The next step is to combine all manifestos extracted by <code>pdf_text()</code>, followed by combining with the ones extracted by <code>pdf_data()</code>.</p>
<p>We run <code>unnest_tokens()</code> on the first set of PDFs. The idea is to <strong>break down our current data which is organized as one-page-per-row, into one-sentence-per-row.</strong> By doing that, we focus our analysis to extract meaning behind each sentence (more on that later), and we also get to keep the page number to cross-reference against the actual document.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>manifestos &lt;- wp_df %&gt;% 
  bind_rows(list(rp_df, spp_df, nsp_df, sda_df, ppp_df)) %&gt;%

                token = &quot;sentences&quot;,
                to_lower = FALSE) </code></pre>
<p>Now that all manifestos are one-sentence-per-row, accounting for bullet points, we can proceed to merge the rest.</p>

<h2>Don’t Judge A Manifesto By Its Length</h2>
<p>Can we gauge the level of detail and amount of discourse within each manifesto by counting the number of sentences and using it as a proxy?</p>

<p>This method is a little too simplistic. Recall that for bullet point-heavy PDFs, we broke down each bullet point into its own sentence and, as a consequence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitespace_character">white spaces</a> were created and also treated as a standalone sentence. Counting sentences alone to gauge the level of detail in each manifesto would inflate the sentence count of bullet-point heavy PDFs.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>pap_df %&gt;% 
  mutate(length = str_count(sentence)) %&gt;% 
  arrange(length)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 272 x 4

##    &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt;
##  1 &quot; &quot;          6 PAP        1

## # ... with 262 more rows</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, this method only takes into account unstructured text information - parties like PAP have supplemented their manifesto heavily with videos which contain valuable policy information. Charts and visualization featured within the manifestos are also not picked up.</p>
<p>That being said, for WP’s manifesto the word count is a good proxy for the timeliness and level of detail it provides in its manifesto, given the entire PDF was released recently but with no charts nor visualization (unfortunately).</p>
</div>
<div id="categorically-speaking" class="section level2">
<h2>Categorically Speaking</h2>
<p>A more accurate way to gauge both <strong>depth and width of detail</strong> would be to categorize sentences, which would also involve counting. The idea is broad topics can be identified by picking out certain words in each sentence that are often used in context. For instance, to identify discussions related to <code>Governance</code>, one could search for key words such as <em>constituencies</em>, <em>parliament</em>, and <em>transparen</em> (not a typo since it picks up both <em>transparent</em> and <em>transparency</em>). I came up with ten broad categories, with remaining sentences classified as <code>Others</code>.</p>

<p>To be clear, this is a general indication of <strong>the frequency political issues are discussed</strong>, and not necessarily an indication of the number of concrete suggestions the party makes i.e. this picks up rhetoric, references, etc.</p>
<p>I acknowledge such classifications are far from perfect due to the complexity and nuances of the English language. For instance, consider this sentence below. My classification labels this sentence as a <code>Social Mobility</code> topic because of the word <em>age</em>, where policies to address income inequality are often targeted at certain segments with an age caveat. However, I’d argue this sentence relates more to <code>Labour</code> since the emphasis is on self-employed people. To further complicate things, both topics do overlap.</p>

<p>In the first and second quantile, the sentences contain random digits separated from sentences and short soundbites. In the remaining two quantiles there are more meaningful sentences discussing infant care centres, online gambling and national security that don’t quite fall into any of the prior categories. There is a sentence addressing rising global temperatures that should be classified under <code>Climate Change</code>, but for the most part I think the search filters are good enough.</p>

facing an unprecedented global economic and health crisis the likes of which have not  been seen in our lifetimes.","This is a particular threat to Singapore’s ability to continue to prosper  as we are already over-reliant on global trade and the Government’s economic model of over-  saving and running huge Budget and current account surpluses.","While we do not criticise the relatively large and unprecedented amounts that the Government is  spending in an effort to protect Singaporeans’ jobs and livelihoods, we believe that it is still not  enough.","As we deal with this crisis we will need to build back Singapore and this is an opportunity to build  back better and fairer.","Because of the severity of the economic crisis hundreds of thousands of ordinary hard-working  Singaporeans face the risk of losing their jobs through no fault of their own.","Reform Party has long campaigned for a better deal for Singaporeans.","In particular we want to  replace the PAP deal of austerity for the ordinary Singaporean but opulent and in many cases  secret salaries and riches for the PM and his wife, PAP Ministers and their spouses and their  supporters.","Take the foreign worker dormitory operators as an example.","Their excess profits have come at  the expense of public safety.","Their mistakes will be compensated out of the pockets of ordinary  Singaporeans and not from the pay packets of our ministers.","It is vital that after this pandemic is over we build a better and fairer society for Singaporeans.","If  our true reserves are at least $1.5 trillion, as my investigations over ten years have led me to  believe, then we can afford to spend perhaps 4% of that every year.","The Norwegians do just that  with the assets in their Pension Fund.","That would mean an additional $60 billion of spending  every year which is about what the Government is spending in this exceptional year on  combating the economic effects of the pandemic.","Some of our specific policy proposals for the 2020 GE are:  1.","Suspension of GST for this year and next and then a review with a view to eliminating it on  certain essential categories of spending like food, utilities and medicines.","2.","Unemployment benefit of up to six months based on 75% of last drawn salary with a cap of  $2500 per month.","3.","Seniors’ benefit for over 65s of $500 per month  4.","Child benefit of $300 per child per month for those at or below 1.5 median incomes  5.","Universal health care","Wednesday, July 1, 2020                           Login    Letter submission

democracy by winning seats in     parliamentary elections.","Political Rights     All citizens should have the right to vote freely without fear,     coercion or discrimination by race, age, gender, occupation     or belief.","Home News Singapore Politics Socio-Political Uncategorized  Singapore — People’s Power Party founder Goh Meng Seng released his party’s manifesto in a  lengthy post on the of cial PPP Facebook page on Saturday (June 27).","The party will be contesting only in MacPherson Single-Member Constituency, whose MP has been  the People’s Action Party’s Tin Pei Ling.","Mr Goh summarised his vision for the SMC into 3 main points:   1.","Old estate with old HDB ats  The PPP leader said the PAP’s Asset Monetisation Scheme had fallen short and that, if elected, he  would ensure that redevelopment and upgrading schemes like HIP, VERS and SERS be carried out as  soon as possible.","2.","Ageing population  Mr Goh said the PAP had not adequately taken care of the needs of the elderly.","If elected, he resolved  to build a community hospital in the estate so that the healthcare needs of the elderly residents would  be suf ciently met.","3.","Poverty and social welfare service  In order to better look after the needy residents in MacPherson, he promised to invite charitable  organisations to provide traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and soup kitchens in the neighbourhood.","Furthermore, for mental purposes, he promised to provide counselling services as well.","Those commenting on the post were largely supportive and sent their well-wishes to Mr Goh.","6.","Free university education for those who have served NS and for the disabled and those who  are exempted on medical grounds.","Women should also be able to benefit from the opportunities  of NS (which would be reduced to six months) as part of a comprehensive commitment to gender  equality including an Equality Act, equal pay and a target of 50% female representation in  Parliament and the boardroom.","This should be mandatory for state-owned companies like  Temasek and its subsidiaries.","7.","Minimum wage of $10 per hour which will ensure more jobs go to Singaporeans and better  wages for foreign workers  8.","Employment pass minimum salary to be raised to at least $5,000 per month with a cap on total  numbers.","Additional tax for new citizens, long-term employment pass holders and PRs who have  not done NS.","9.","Singaporeans are entitled to be angry over being misled about the true nature of their HDB  leasehold which has been scandalously mis-sold to them as an asset that can never decline in  value by PAP leaders including LKY and PM Lee.","Reform Party will review the leasehold nature  of HDB with a view to giving Singaporeans the freehold or allowing them to extend their leases  before expiry.","These proposals will allow us to build a fairer and better society for all Singaporeans not just an  elite few.","It has been announced on 30 June that Singapore Democratic Alliance (SDA) will be contesting in  a three-cornered fight in Pasir Ris-Punggol group representation constituency (GRC) against  People’s Voice and People’s Action Party.","This will be the first time this GRC will see three parties contesting since the elections in 1992.","The five-member team will consist of Desmond Lim Bak Chuan, Harminder Pal Singh, Abu  Mohamed, as well as new faces Kelvin Ong and Kuswadi Atnawi.","One day before Nomination Day on 30 June, SDA released its manifesto titled “A Heart for the  People’.","The party said the struggles the constituents have shared with them included “the loss of good  jobs for young Singaporeans, a spike in the cost of living, the Central Provident Fund (CPF)  savings scheme, and the widening inequality gap in Singapore”.","The core of its manifesto was crafted on the back of the “pain of (these current) policies” and it  proposes solutions tackling these four specific challenges.","1.","Reduce Goods and Services Tax (GST) To 3% On Basic Items  SDA foresees an increase in GST will “devastate low- to middle-income Singaporeans who are  already grappling with the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic”.","It is proposing to cut GST for basic items such as food, common household products and other  essential items to 3 per cent, and a progressive GST tax system of 3 per cent to 15 per cent,  where different groups of goods are pegged to different taxes – basic goods are taxed the least,  while luxury items are taxed the most.","SDA has also proposed cutting spending on “extravagant public projects”, citing examples such as  the upcoming Founders’ Memorial and recent Jewel Changi Airport.","“While development of new infrastructure is necessary, expenditure must be exercised with  prudence — especially when long-term maintenance costs are taken into account,” it said.","SDA proposed “a more stringent set of checks” on the expenditure of such projects.","The  reductions from these can be afforded to the people instead, the manifesto stated.","2.","Tackle Social Inequality  To support youths from disadvantaged families, SDA strives to pump an extra 1 to 5 per cent of the  Government’s annual Net Investment Returns (NIR) into this demographic group.","The Workers’ Party Manifesto 2020                                                   A Singapore For All  PREAMBLE: A SINGAPORE FOR ALL  This is our vision for Singapore:       •   Singaporeans must be enabled to achieve their dreams: starting from our schools to           ensure all our children are given the right tools and support to fulfil their potential and           ambitions, and having social policies that support hardworking families to achieve           their dreams.","•   We must forge a dynamic economy with competitive, locally-based firms that can           withstand global and internal forces of change, while providing dignified jobs for our           workers.","•   We will work together to build the home that we want: tackling the cost of living,           having a robust health and social care system, with sustainable and affordable           housing and liveable communities.","•   An accountable democracy and resilient Singapore is one where robust political,           governance and defence institutions protect our security.","We should embrace a           diversity of views and encourage robust debate about the way forward.                                                                                                          i","POPULATION GROWTH  Proper Planning     Singapore should undertake its population growth gradually     in alignment with its infrastructure readiness.","A sudden     population growth without good foresight and proper     planning should never be repeated.","The population growth     should be organic with initiatives to increase our total     fertility rate, where the Government shall provide parents     options to a comprehensive security net for their children     (up to 18 years of age).","NATIONAL ECONOMY     NSP is committed to an open and free competitive economy     in which the Government’s economic responsibilities shall     generally be confined to the formulation of policies to     enhance national development and economic growth.","While a steady inflow of sizeable foreign investments should     be sustained consistently, a balanced ratio between foreign     versus local investments shall be maintained.","Local SMEs and micro businesses shall be assisted to lower     business costs, increase productivity and enhance     competitiveness.","NSP believes in the human potential, dignity and rights of all     people, regardless of race, language or religion.","The ways in which social inequalities may be reduced for the youths include modern technological  equipment, conducive after-school care at dedicated centres near their homes, and having  caregivers and tutors to motivate and coach them.","“A fraction of this would go a long way in helping over 100,000 disadvantaged Singaporean  families break the poverty cycle,” it said.","The NIR are returns from Singapore’s national  investments.","3.","Full Withdrawal Of CPF Savings At 62  SDA proposes another change to the current CPF system which allows the elderly to withdraw the  full sum of their CPF savings as soon as they turn 62, which is the current retirement age,  although a portion of their CPF should be reserved in MediSave and MediShield Life for health  emergencies.","“It is better to die than to fall ill.","This speaks multitudes for the plight of ageing Singaporeans.","Not  only must (the elderly) toil into their twilight years, they fear being a financial burden to their  children,” it stated.","4.","Restrict Hiring Of Foreign Workers  To ensure there are not only sufficient jobs for Singaporeans, but compatible jobs for them, the  party wants stricter qualifying criteria for the hiring of foreign working professionals by local firms.","Introducing a cap on the number of foreign workers and conducting diligent checks and balances  on the educational qualifications of these individuals, to ensure that they have graduated only from  universities that are accredited by the Singapore Government, can help alleviate the hiring  discrepancy.","It also proposes to tighten the labour auditing process to prevent the abuse of hiring regulations  and policies.","Share this:       Twitter    Facebook  Tags:     Abu Mohamed      Desmond Lim       GE 2020    Harminder Pal Singh

Every 5 years, we have the opportunity to exercise our democratic right to vote.","Soon, you will have the chance to do the same.","In this manifesto, we hope to help  you understand some of the SPP’s policy positions and guiding principles.","Although  it is unlikely that we will be in a position to implement policy as we will not form the  government, these are matters that we will advocate for in Parliament, should we be  given the honour of serving you.","Our policies and positions are designed to tackle not just the short-term issues posed  and/or exacerbated by COVID-19, but also take a long-term approach as some things  do warrant a fundamental rethink instead of mere cosmetic change.","Our Manifesto is prefaced and built upon our three guiding principles of Accountability  Commitment and Empathy.","Policies may shift, opinions may change, and different  solutions may be required for different times.","What will always be consistent are the  values that underpin our policies and actions.","Accountability – We believe that it is our role to ensure that the powers that be     remain accountable to the people.","Accountability can and should be improved     through both action and institutional reform.","Commitment – We are always committed to adding value to the lives of     Singaporeans.","Both on the ground and in Parliament, we have always strived for the     betterment of lives.","Since 1994, we have been consistently committed to serving you,     the people of Singapore.","Empathy – In Singapore, there is no shortage of great ideas.","Many of our leaders may     have the best credentials and solutions, but we cannot forget the value of empathy     and the human touch.","At the SPP, compassion and empathy is at the heart of what we     believe in.","As you peruse our manifesto, do keep in mind that this is simply the start of a  conversation.","In Singapore, it is essential that we have a contest of ideas, a multitude  of narratives, and credible alternatives so that the best results for Singaporeans can be  produced.","Although we have split our manifesto into 10 sections for ease of reference, it should be  viewed holistically as some ideas cut across categories.","In the process of drafting this manifesto, we have had the privilege of working with  some of the brightest minds and kindest souls.","We put on record our appreciation for  their time and efforts.","Without their contributions, this would not have been possible.","In  some areas, we advocate for incremental change.","In others, we believe it is necessary to  have a paradigm shift.","In all areas, we look forward to igniting debate and starting a conversation about what  is best for Singapore and her people.","We look forward to working together with you  towards a better tomorrow.","Singapore People’s Party | Manifesto","Taxation      The Government shall not increase further the current      Goods and Service Tax (GST) of 7% to 9% and look beyond      the GST mechanism for alternative source.","More tax credits shall be given to citizens caring for their      aged parents and school-going children.","These credits can      be the form of tax rebates in their annual income taxes.","Privatisation      Certain essential entities are an integral part of the national      infrastructure and they shall be sustained by a responsible      government.","Such entities shall not depend on      shareholders’ interest alone as is the norm with privatised      organisations.","The Government justification for the privatisation of certain      national entities fell short because some of these entities      are either monopolies or oligopolies, at present and in the      foreseeable future.","Employment      Citizens should be entitled to foremost priority in the      engagement and employment of workforce.","Citizens should be entitled to foremost priority in the      engagement and employment of

too.","All over the world,  young leaders are rising up and making themselves heard.","At SPP, we don’t  just pay lip service to the youth.","We walk the talk.","We have the youngest  CEC amongst all opposition parties in Singapore and our Assistant Secretary  General, Mr Ariffin Sha, is 22 years-old.","In the preparation of this manifesto,  we have engaged with and sought the views of many young people from  diverse backgrounds.","SPP is committed to policies and ideas that empower  our youth.","1.","Reducing the voting age from 21 to 18  The current age of 21 is arbitrary and disenfranchises many young people.","By  most, if not all, definitions, a 18 year-old is an adult. 18  year-olds should have a say in policies and laws that affect them.","The youth of Singapore has a strong political consciousness.","They have a rich  history of shaping political discourse.","If it were not for the student activists who  were pivotal in the push for Singapore’s independence, we may still be singing  “God Save the Queen” instead of Majulah Singapura.","This “wokeness” can  be witnessed even today, as young people are spearheading the fight against  climate change, amongst other causes.","Allowing 18 year-olds to have a say in the state of affairs in Singapore adds a  fresh perspective that will lead to a more vibrant contest of ideas.","Singapore People’s Party | Manifesto","The Workers’ Party Manifesto 2020                                                  A Singapore For All  CHAPTER 1:  TACKLING COVID-19  AND THRIVING IN A POST-COVID WORLD  The Covid-19 pandemic has caused widespread economic and social disruption across the  globe.","It is a public health emergency which could overwhelm Singapore’s healthcare system  if not adequately managed.","Restrictions imposed to curb the spread of the disease have  dealt a terrible blow to our economy and hurt the livelihoods of many Singaporeans.","We acknowledge the government’s efforts so far in dealing with this crisis.","We support the  safe distancing measures put in place to contain Covid-19 and urge fellow Singaporeans to  comply with them — for their own safety and that of the rest of the community.","At the same time, although the crisis is still ongoing, it is our duty as a responsible opposition  party to make a constructive contribution to the policy discussion on how best to deal with  this outbreak and emerge stronger as a nation.","TACKLING THE CRISIS  The Covid-19 pandemic required a decisive and effective response, and any easing of  restrictions need to finely calibrate kick-starting the economy while ensuring we do not face  a second runaway wave of infections.","It is equally important that this, and any future  pandemics, must strengthen — not weaken — our social harmony and resilience as a people.","Singaporeans must resolve to work together as a nation to defeat pandemics, not as  individuals weathering the storm on their own.","Listen to medical experts  The initial governmental advice telling people not to wear masks unless they are feeling  unwell appears to have been driven more by concerns about a shortage of masks.","1","PUBLIC HOUSING  Core Responsibility of HDB     HDB shall resume its core responsibility i.e. provision of     quality public housing for the masses at cost-plus prices.","Transparency     HDB shall release comprehensive detail of the costs (land,     construction, development, administrative, etc) of each     project on its website before launching it, to allow     evaluation of its cost efficiency.","Financial Assistance     The Government should render more assistance to those     with genuine financial difficulties.","Subsidised Rental Flats     More subsidized rental flats should be developed to reduce     the waiting time for those citizens who are in dire needs.","Such flats should be prohibited from being used to house     foreign workers.","Restriction on PRs     HDB flats owned by PRs should be prohibited from resale     within 8 years’ of ownership, and any profit realised from     the sale thereof should be subject to taxation to prevent     speculative transaction.","Such flats should also be prohibited     from being leased out either wholly or in part.","A Better Tomorrow    3       2.","Allowing the use of parent’s CPF monies for education  Currently, the CPF Education Scheme allows members to use CPF savings from their  Ordinary Account (OA) to pay for their children’s tuition fees.","The student has to  repay the amount withdrawn, with

to all residents.","Would many infections have been prevented if the advice had been given earlier to wear  masks to cut down the risk of infection, as advised by some doctors from the beginning?","Covid-19 is first and foremost a public health crisis.","The key solutions to resolving this crisis  will come from medical experts.","In the event of future pandemics, we recommend the  formation of an independent medical advisory board making both public and private  recommendations to the government’s medical team, to act as a source of alternative  perspectives and advice to the government’s doctors, and to pre-empt any possible blind  spots.","A whole-of-society response would benefit from non-political, medical figures fronting  everyday behavioural advice to the general public.","Expand testing for Covid-19  Recent studies have found that a significant percentage of individuals testing positive for  Covid-19 are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic.","There is strong evidence that asymptomatic  and pre-symptomatic persons can transmit the virus in the community.","Because of this, Singapore should continue to expand its current testing regime to include  more wide-spread community testing for the coronavirus.","This involves testing a large  number of people within the community, including those who may not present symptoms.","By pre-emptively identifying individuals who carry the virus, authorities can isolate and care  for them, and perform contact tracing, and thus further stem the spread of the virus.","This  should be done in parallel with existing testing, treatment and contact tracing for  symptomatic individuals.","Communities which are at higher risk of infection should be prioritised for such testing.","All  individuals who report even mild symptoms should be swabbed, as should their close  contacts.","As our testing capacity increases, more random tests in the community should be  conducted to identify asymptomatic cases.","When our borders are eventually opened, all  incoming travellers must be tested and cleared before being allowed to mingle in the local  community.","A national effort to leverage domestic biomedical R&D and manufacturing  resources should be made to ramp up production of test kits to make this possible.","Expanded community testing will enable the health authorities to more precisely identify  and isolate infected individuals, which would facilitate a safer re-opening of our battered  economy.","2","HEALTHCARE  Comprehensive Medical Insurance     The Government shall undertake to

population  disproportionately.","This is especially so when essential items are not exempt  from GST.","In the Budget preceding GE 2015, the Government noted that it has raised  the revenue needed for public spending for the next 5 years.","Memorably,  at GE 2015, PM Lee argued that GST will only be increased if there was  “Profligate spending and irresponsible, unsustainable plans.”","However, in  2018, it was announced that the GST will be increased to 9%.","Although this  GST hike has been postponed to 2021, we question the necessity of the hike.","The Government has had a healthy budget surplus in the past years.","Further,  the Government can also tap on various other mechanisms to increase  revenue like a higher income tax for the top 1% or re-introducing estate duty.","There is no reason for the Government to increase the GST where it can  use other more equitable measures to increase revenue that have not yet  been exhausted.","Until the contrary is proven, an increase in GST is simply  unjustifiable.","Singapore People’s Party | Manifesto","The Workers’ Party Manifesto 2020                                                A Singapore For All  Implement effective contact tracing while safeguarding privacy  Rapid contact tracing holds the other key to enable a safer and wider re-opening of the  economy.","Manual methods of contact tracing can take too long to be effective, especially if  the number of cases balloons as restrictions are eased.","Technology can enable contact  tracers to much more quickly identify contacts and call them in for testing.","The

cross-border interoperability.","While an  ENS-based solution would have been preferable for reasons of cost and convenience, with  wearable devices given only to those who do not own smartphones, the key now is to ensure  widespread use of the nationally adopted contact tracing solution, minimising attempts at  evasion.","To that end, the public should be reassured that robust privacy protections are in  place.","To protect the privacy of Singaporeans, the TraceTogether code should remain open source  and gather only data that is absolutely necessary for contact tracing.","Third party privacy

elderly persons received monthly CPF payouts of less than  $500.","These figures paint a worrying picture as it shows that a significant  number of our aged population may not have the means to maintain even a  basic standard of living.","Unlike working adults, the aged will suffer the brunt of  the rising cost of living as their relative earning capacity is lower.","Currently, eligible Singaporeans receive quarterly payouts of $180 - $900.","This is clearly insufficient to maintain a basic standard of living.","We propose  that the quantum of the cash supplement be doubled and that the cash  supplement be distributed monthly, instead of quarterly.","In addition, those  who qualify for the Silver Support Scheme should also have free travel on  public transport.","The quantum should also be regularly reviewed (instead of  only once every 5 years) to track increases in the cost of living.","3.","Introduce minimum wage  A nationwide study should be commissioned to determine the amount  needed for one to maintain a basic standard of living.","Following the study,  a national minimum wage should be instituted and pegged to the amount  required for one to meet their basic

Strengthening retirement adequacy  through CPF  In 1955, the CPF was a relatively straightforward scheme – both the employer  and employee contribute 5% every month and the sum can be withdrawn  when the contributor is 55 years-old.","Over the years, the goal posts have  shifted and the CPF scheme has become increasingly complex.","One of our  founding fathers, Mr Toh Chin Chye, argued that it amounted to “a breach of  fundamental principles”.","In our opinion, the most fundamental principle that has been breached is  that of autonomy.","It is only fair that Singaporeans have a say over how they  utilise their own savings.","The often-cited justification for this is the fear that  contributors may elect to squander their savings away in a short amount of  time.","However, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support the assertion.","In any case, we submit that just like how we don’t ban driving due to a  minority of irresponsible drivers, it also makes no sense to prevent the majority  of contributors from receiving their hard earned monies due to the purported  actions of a hypothetical minority.","Another justification our Government has for increasing the withdrawal age  and sum is retirement adequacy.","In Singapore, CPF and retirement adequacy  are almost inextricably linked, or so they say.","The real picture, however, is  worrying.","Minister Josephine Teo revealed in Parliament that only 53% of  contributors achieved the minimum sum and that 74% of contributors receive  less than $500 a month.","This is clearly insufficient for retirement adequacy.","Simple tweaks to the CPF system cannot ensure retirement adequacy.","The  SPP believes that the CPF scheme must be revamped to better reflect its  fundamental principles and ensure retirement adequacy.","Singapore People’s Party | Manifesto","The Workers’ Party Manifesto 2020                                                 A Singapore For All  Enforcement efforts must be stepped

Singaporeans, in our everyday lives, to treat all foreign workers with the  respect, courtesy and concern that all people deserve.","This should be seen as not only a  question of social justice but one of national security and public health.","The Covid-19 crisis  has shown that lapses on this front can harm Singaporeans.","Strengthen social safety nets for retrenched workers  The potentially large scale unemployment that the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to cause  highlights the need for stronger social safety nets for workers who find themselves  involuntarily unemployed.","We elaborate on this in our proposal for a Redundancy Insurance  scheme.","Redundancy Insurance will not only ease the immediate financial pressure that  retrenched workers face, but will also provide an automatic stabiliser to the economy —  consumer spending will be sustained to help prevent the economy from spiralling  downwards.","Build on digital gains made during the crisis  It has been said that Covid-19 has ironically been one of the biggest drivers of digital  transformation in the workplace.","Singapore should build on the gains made in the  proliferation of working from home, home based learning, remote meetings and staggered  working hours, as a way to improve productivity, work life balance and job satisfaction for our  people.","Companies which put in place telecommuting policies during the time of the crisis should  continue to allow employees to work from home and work flexibly wherever feasible.","Positive  shifts in our local work culture spurred by the crisis should not be allowed to go to waste.","Government programmes that support digitalisation among enterprises should encourage  companies, particularly SMEs, to engage digitalisation beyond obvious work-streams such as

concerning for a scheme that  was designed precisely to allow Singaporeans to retire comfortably.","Whether  through top-ups or supplementary schemes, a fundamental re-think of the CPF  scheme is necessary to ensure that it serves its purpose.","2.","Allowing partial withdrawals on compassionate grounds  Currently, to withdraw CPF funds on other grounds, contributors must meet  an extremely narrow set of conditions.","We believe that when contributors are  faced with a dire situation or a rainy day, they should be allowed to partially  withdraw their CPF monies to tide over tough waters.","At the very least, they  must be allowed to “borrow” from their CPF monies.","The prerequisites for  withdrawal on compassionate grounds should also be widened and dealt with  on a case-by-case basis.","3.","Publication of CPF investment returns  In the interests of transparency and accountability, the return on investments  from the investment of CPF monies should be made public.","Publication will  also help to retain the trust of the populace by showing that the Government  can pay off its debts.","On years when the returns are better than expected, the  Government

vulnerability to global supply  chain shocks.","Many countries would want to pull more essential manufacturing and services  provision back to their domestic economies or economic blocs, and indeed we

The enactment of a Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) will serve 2 main  purposes:-  Firstly, a FOIA will serve as a potent antidote against the spread of fake news.","By allowing for the free flow of information and public access to information,  fake news will be easily debunked without the need to employ any mechanisms  of the state.","Singaporeans are a reasonable people; if information is readily  available, they will be a lot less likely to fall prey to fake news.","Facts, not the  force of the law, is the most effective weapon in the fight against fake news.","Secondly, a FOIA will help to level the playing field by solving the information  dissymmetry that currently exists in policy discussion.","Academics, politicians  and civil society representatives often find themselves handicapped and run  the risk of perpetuating fake news when they discuss and debate public policy.","With information being readily available and legislation that mandates the  Government to declassify documents after stipulated periods of time, we can  ensure that there will be more informed debate that will lead to better ideas for  all Singaporeans.","Singapore People’s Party |

higher 2nd-tier miscellaneous fees, enjoy greater economies of  scale and have wealthy alumni who donate to fund better facilities and programmes.","The  student bodies of popular schools are also usually better able to afford programmes  requiring significant co-payment.","As a result, these schools offer more varied sports and  enrichment programmes, attract bigger enrolments and generate more funding in a  virtuous circle.","Less popular schools should receive further baseline funding on top of the current per  capita funding.","This will ensure that these schools are able to offer

GIC and the net interest payable on CPF member balances.","To boost retirement adequacy, a third of this difference, where positive, should be returned  as a special dividend and paid into CPF members’ Special Accounts.","Ensure Inclusivity for Persons with Disabilities (PWDs)  PWDs must be given more support to live fully enabled lives.","Anti-discrimination legislation  should specifically address PWDs, with the civil service taking the lead in employing PWDs  where possible.","The current Assistive Technology Fund administered by SG Enable should be made more  flexible,

Educational institutions and facilities that house the elderly,  there is an especially acute need for ready access to mental health professionals.","2.","Unpaid mental health leave  90% of psychological conditions in working Singaporeans are caused by  workplace stress.","Employees should be able to take unpaid mental health  leave to cope with work burn-out and attend to their mental health needs.","3.","More appropriate sentencing options for offenders  Mandatory Treatment Orders (“MTOs”) are one of the most progressive  sentencing options for offenders in Singapore.","However, the perquisites for  one to be sentenced to an MTO are stringent.","We echo the Honourable Chief  Justice Sundaresh Menon’s recent call for Parliament to review the criteria  for sentencing under MTOs to allow offenders suffering from mental health  disorders to be sentenced more appropriately so that they can get the help  they need.","4.","Greater subsidies for mental health services  We call on the Government to provide greater subsidies for mental health  services, especially for the disadvantaged communities.","The current  withdrawal limits of $500 (from Medisave) should be increased to better reflect  the actual costs of treatment, which is about $300 a month.","The last thing we  would want as a nation is for one to hesitate to seek professional help due to a  lack of resources.","Singapore People’s Party | Manifesto","The Workers’ Party Manifesto 2020                                                 A Singapore For All  progress in empowering vulnerable groups to

more competitive and unequal in terms of wealth and  income.","To level the playing field for children of low-income families, the Kidstart programme  needs to be expanded beyond the current pilot

cycle.","Equalise childcare subsidies for all women, including home-makers  Mothers engaged in paid employment for more than 56 hours a week are currently granted  more childcare subsidies.","This

part-time or be part of the gig economy,  working less than 56 hours per month, leaving them ineligible for full childcare subsidies.","Childcare subsidies should be equalised for all children,

also must not lose sight of another founding principle of the HDB  policy – affordability.","HDBs are becoming increasingly unaffordable  for younger Singaporeans and first-time buyers, and our policies in  relation to the pricing of flats have to be re-evaluated.","1.","Extending the lease buyback scheme  After a period of 5 years, all HDB owners should be given the option to sell  their leases back to the HDB at a price that is near the market value.","This  initiative will allow a win-win situation for both homeowners and the HDB.","Homeowners will take comfort in the fact that they

priority for citizenship naturalisation if they apply after 5  years on the LTVP+, on the condition that they have been married to their current  Singaporean spouse for 3 years or more and they have at least one child together.","The  evaluation criteria for such cases should be made transparent.","Given that over 20% of existing marriages are between a Singapore citizen and a foreign  spouse,

multiculturalism, it may be the  case that the ethnic quota has served its purpose.","The ethnic quota also may be prohibitive to sellers from minority races looking  to sell their HDB flats as, due to a smaller pool of potential buyers, they may  have to price their flats lower than a flat which has no eligibility criteria for  buyers.","Malay, Indian and Eurasian homeowners should not have the

the SME sector for industries receiving government support.","This will  then be used for reviewing the return on investment.","Keep commercial and industrial rents manageable  Rent is a significant cost for local SMEs.","Although the government has launched several new  JTC Corporation (JTC) industrial hubs and low-rent incubator facilities for start-ups, the  corporatisation of JTC assets in the past has reduced access to low-rent public sector  industrial space.","Pegging HDB rents to commercial rates also places a large burden on the  micro-businesses and start-ups operating in our heartlands.","JTC should expand its market share for industrial space, and to continue offering low-rent  options for SMEs alongside its private sector-run facilities.","Each of these would offer a  different price-value mix.","HDB should offer low-rent commercial spaces allocated by ballot, to stimulate micro-  businesses and entrepreneurship in the heartlands.","To minimise rental surges seen in the last decade, government commercial and industrial  land policy must ensure that the level of commercial and industrial rental growth should not  outpace inflation.","Nurture Silver industries  As one of the most rapidly ageing societies in the world, there will be increased need for  nursing homes, assisted living facilities, senior day-care/activity centres and home care.","However, the adoption of technology amongst these service providers could be lagging  behind countries like Japan, Korea, China and Thailand, where innovations like robotics and  wearable technology have already made a tangible impact.","Our economic and ministerial agencies in charge of elder-care should work with local  enterprises and government-linked research centres to promote the use of productivity-  enhancing technology amongst care service providers.","Test-bedding and perfecting care innovations domestically will enable our local firms to  export these innovations to overseas markets, helping to drive our economic engine.","17","A Better Tomorrow    19      2.","Introducing financial literacy into syllabus  Many students emerge out of the education system being financially illiterate.","At both a primary school level and the secondary school level, students should  be taught fundamental financial skills like saving, budgeting, etc.","At a more  advanced level, they should also be taught about CPF, taxes, investing, etc.","This will ensure that our students are ready for the workforce and will ensure  they make more financially sound decisions.","3.","Smaller teacher-student ratios  Schools should thrive to have smaller student-teacher ratios so that each  student will be able to receive more attention from the teachers.","This will  also give teachers a more manageable workload and will be able to tailor  their approach to better suit individual needs.","Teachers should also be given  less administrative work to allow them to focus primarily on their work in  the

Citizens with grievances are currently deterred from seeking redress through legal action by  considerations of cost and the difficulty of gathering evidence in the context of rules and  laws such as the Official Secrets Act.","This is made even more problematic with the recent  approach of disclosing personal details of some citizens who have raised grievances.","There should be an independent Office of the Ombudsman.","Any citizen who is aggrieved by  the action of any public servant would be able to lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman to  seek recourse.","This would provide citizens with

anonymity for  complaints made in good faith, similar to that required by the Singapore Exchange for  whistleblowing policies for listed companies.","The Ombudsman would be empowered to  advise on corrective actions and recommend prosecutions.","This will enhance government accountability and create more options for citizens to seek  redress without fear of reprisals or

for further extension.","The present provisions for the appointment of fixed-term  Judicial Commissioners and short-term Senior Judges should be removed.","Extensions and  short-term appointments weaken the protective wall that upholds judicial independence.","The Administration of Justice (Protection) Act, which seeks to protect Court proceedings  from external influence, should be amended to scrap the government immunity clause,  which unjustifiably allows the government to comment on Court proceedings in ways that  members of the public cannot.","The threshold for the offence of scandalising the judiciary  should be restored to a “real risk” rather than merely a \"risk\", to avoid excessively harsh  treatment of public discussions about judicial decisions.","We propose that

the Cost of Living In Singapore","\nDespite PM Lee Hsien Loong's to “work with you to solve problems like the cost of living” during the GE in 2015, the PAP and government increased, or intends to

Tharman Shanmugaratnam had declared in his Budget 2015 speech that all the increased spending were sufficiently funded until 2020","\nTo temper this rising cost of living, we proposed 10 measures"," 1","\nCut ministerial pay to fund assistance schemes for the poor Ministerial salaries be reduced with the savings channelled to fund a scheme to provide financial support for the poorest of our poor","\nIf the salaries are reduced according to our formula proposed in our policy paper Ethical salaries for a public-centred government, the PM's salary would be reduced from the current $2","2

amount would go towards providing seed funding for for the elderly and poor","\nPM Lee said in the 2015 GE"," “Let us be prepared to buckle, work even sacrifice","”\nOur ministers must lead by example, not mere exhortations","\nOtherwise, they will lose even more of their fast- diminishing moral authority, and it would be difficult to govern effectively without the people's respect and trust","\n2","\nRaise income tax rate for the top 1 percent In 2007, Singapore’s highest personal income tax rate was cut from 28 percent to 20 percent","\nThe SDP proposes that the tax bracket for the top 1 percent earners be brought back up to 28 percent","\nExperts estimate that raising the top marginal income tax rate by 1 percentage point could result in the government’s tax revenue increasing by approximately $300 million","\nThe additional revenue will go a long way to provide further financial relief for low-income families","\n3","\nEnsure revenue neutral budgets Rather than register huge surpluses every year, the government should collect in taxes only the amount that it needs","\nIf it says, as DPM Tharman did in 2015, that the government has all its spending needs taken care of for the rest of the decade, then it should not raise taxes, fees and other charges during this period","\n4","\nScrap GST for essential items, raise GST for luxury goods Basic food items as well as other basic necessities such as medical treatment and school supplies should not be subject to the GST","\nThis is to protect poorer households from regressive taxation","\nTo offset the reduction in revenue, the GST rate for luxury items should be increased to 10 percent or more","\nPresently, a poor family https","//yoursdp","org/news/12-1 2/4","6/30/2020 Singapore Democratic Party

democracy and the rights of Singaporeans","\nBecause of this, problems have been emerging","\nIncome inequality, a dispirited workforce, the absence of an entrepreneurial class, our reputation as a tax haven, and the unhappiness of the local populace with the influx of foreign labour have raised questions about the sustainability of the country's current economic model","\nSDP's Solution https","//yoursdp","org/policy/economy 1/4","6/30/2020 Singapore Democratic Party | Policy | Economy The SDP has drawn up an alternative economic programme to chart a different course for our

Singaporeans","\nIt is also an alternative that is both realistic and sustainable","\nOur vision is to create an economic system that benefits all Singaporeans, one that makes our society more egalitarian by tapping on the people's innovative best","We seek to level up society","\nWe need a system that works for the people, not vice versa","\nAt a glance, this is the SDP's plan"," 1","\nRedefine economic progress We propose an alternative indicator of economic progress","\nThe PAP relies on GDP growth as a measure of society's wellness","\nThe problem is that GDP is a misleading indicator that does not take into account the cost (social, environmental and financial) of production","\nWith an alternative index, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), that comprehensively measures the cost and benefit of economic growth, we can better gauge the efficacy of our policies","\nUnder our programme, the quality of life and overall happiness of our citizens will be the guiding factor for economic growth","\n2","\nReduce income inequality As Singapore's GDP growth rate rises, so has income inequality and poverty in the country","\nTo ensure that workers are not exploited, we propose the legislation of a national minimum wage","\nRetrenchment insurance will also be introduced to provide retrenched workers with support while they look for re-employment","\n3","\nEncourage entrepreneurship Our workers' productivity has been falling to dismal levels","\nTo address this problem, we will work to ensure that our society is free and open so that innovation can thrive","\nWorkers must be intrinsically motivated; only this will ensure that they excel in whatever they do and add value to the goods and services they produce","\nWe also aim to cut down on importing cheap foreign labour and ensure that employers employ Singaporeans first","\nOnly when local talent cannot be found should foreigners be employed","\n4","\nEliminate GLCs, increase SMEs We aim to encourage enterprise by divesting inefficient government-linked companies (GLCs), which are competing with and slowing down the growth of our small and medium enterprises (SMEs), of their untouchable status","\nOne effective way to help local SMEs grow is to reduce land costs and rentals","\nWe will also work towards weaning our economy off its addiction to multinational corporations (MNCs)","\n5","\nRemake the GIC/Temasek model Singapore's reserves are, effectively, kept with the government through two conglomerates"," the Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) and Temasek Holdings (TH)","\nThese entities are currently being run in a less than transparent manner","\nThe SDP believes that our country's reserves should work for the

care must be increased in order to support the needy and elderly","\n7","\nAbolish the CPF Minimum Sum Scheme Retirees depend on their CPF savings to meet living expenses","\nWithholding their savings through the Minimum Sum Scheme is not only impractical but also immoral","\nThe scheme must be abolished and the money returned to members when they turn 55 as originally promised","\n8","\nEmpower workers Beyond a certain level, no amount of coercion can bring about higher-quality output and productivity","\nWe must empower our workers and upgrade their minds and attitudes by returning them their freedom; it is when they feel a sense of belonging to society that they will be motivated to contribute more than what is asked of them","\nSingapore needs a new economic model that will take us into a new era of sustainable growth – one that will allow us to compete on the international stage instead of consigning our workers to a cycle of working harder and longer for less and less; one

address HDB's 99-year lease crisis National Development Minister Lawrence Wong caused a stir in 2017 when he said that “As the leases run down, especially towards the tail-end, the flat prices will come down correspondingly","”\nSingaporeans have expressed much concern over the matter as many hope to sell their flats at a profit that they can use for retirement","\n“But depreciating values, especially of ageing flats, mean that owners cannot depend on their flats as a nest-egg,” Mr John Tan said during the launch","\n“The problem is compounded by the fact many Singaporeans have depleted their CPF savings to pay for their flats","”\nThe NOM scheme will price new HDB flats to include administrative, material, labour costs only but without land “cost” that is currently the practice","\nAs a result, prices of flats will be substantially lower, ranging from $70,000 for 2-room flats to $240,000 for 5-room flats or even less","\n“As the name implies, however, flats bought under this scheme will not be allowed to be re-sold in the open market,” co-presenter Mr Bryan Lim said","\nOwners wishing to dispose of their NOM flats will have to sell them back to the HDB, he added","\nSingaporeans who purchase these flats can expect to take 9 to 15 years to pay off their housing loans (based on an interest rate of 3 percent) using no more than 20 percent of their gross income","\nThis further reduces the financial burden of home-buyers many of whom currently service their loans on a 30-year basis","\nThe lowered housing expenditure will free up capital for homeowners to save for their retirement","\nThe rationale for NOM flats, Mr Lim pointed out, is that the government should not profit from Singaporeans when it comes to public housing and Singaporeans should not use it as a means of investment for capital gain","\nPublic housing is a social good and should be used to meet the housing needs of the population, not profit-making for the government or citizens","\nCurrent homeowners Existing HDB owners can continue to sell their flats in the open market (OM)","\nOf course, they are subjected to the vagaries of the prevailing market","\nHowever,

subject to a cap","\nThis money will be credited back to the owner's CPF account or used to pay any outstanding housing loan that one may have taken","\nThe converted flats will then be subjected to rules governing NOM flats","\nThe NOM scheme essentially gives Singaporeans an added option of buying a home at a greatly reduced price","\nFirst-time HDB buyers can choose to buy an OM or NOM flat","\nEnsuring a stable housing market The NOM system will be introduced in a gradual manner to prevent a shock to the existing system and a sudden market correction","\nThis will provide stability

experience","\nOnly those who meet the required number of points will qualify for a list of potential employees","\nEmployers will then be allowed to hire foreigners from this pool but will have to demonstrate that no Singaporean is available or qualifies for the position before that","\n“This will prevent firms hiring foreigners based solely on their ability to accept lower wages,” said Ms Tan, a communications professional who has held executive positions in local and international corporations","\nShe currently works in a regional company","\nThe SDP's proposal comes amidst a rising proportion of Singapore PMETs getting retrenched","\nSuch a trend is partly the result of hundreds of local companies continuing to discriminate against local workers","\nMs Tan also took issue with the idea that Singapore can accommodate a 10 million population","\nThe idea was raised by Mr Heng Swee Keat recently","\nWith a population density that is one of the highest in the world, Singapore can ill-afford to grow a population of 10 million by bringing in more foreigners","\nAs it is, Singaporeans are one of the unhappiest and most stressed out workers in the world","\nBy not taking into consideration the physical and mental well-being of the people, the PAP's current approach of cramming more foreigners onto this island is counter-productive","\nCEC member Mr Khung Wai Yeen, who presented the policy with Ms Tan, pointed this out","\nHe also noted the low birthrate and high emigration rate that is causing the Singaporean population to shrink","\nHe cited the high cost of living and stressful lifestyle as causes of younger Singaporeans leaving the country or having fewer children","\nTo address this problem, the SDP has proposed a 10-point plan under another policy A Better Life For All"," Keeping The Cost Of Living In Singapore Affordable to make Singapore less expensive","\n“Raising taxes and fees on a slew of items in the last couple of years makes Singapore even more expensive and, hence, exacerbates the problem of a shrinking population,” Ms Tan pointed out","\n“This is why the raising of the GST to 9 percent from the current 7 percent is a bad idea","”

objective of an SDP-managed Town Council (TC) is to maintain a clean and well-kept housing estate while keeping expenditure down so that Services and Conservancy Charges (S&CC) can be kept to a minimum","\nThe statement was made today at the launch of A Promise To The Residents"," The SDP Town Council Management Plan this afternoon","\nPresented by Party Secretary-General Chee Soon Juan and Vice-Chairman John Tan, the paper said that SDP MPs will run the TC on a full-time basis rather than engage a managing agent (MA)","\nCurrently, most TCs engage MAs except for the Bishan-Toa Payoh TC","\nMAs are profit-driven","private companies and charge an additional fee for managing the TC","\nThis is an added layer of cost to the residents","\nThe SDP will, instead, hire qualified and experienced professionals to assist the MPs in running the TC","\nThe savings of not engaging an MA will be passed on to the residents through lower S&CC","\nDr Chee said that while there have been suggestions that MPs be allowed to focus on legislative work in Parliament while leaving the management of TC municipal matters to others, the SDP's stand is that we relish the challenge of doing both","\nIn government, lawmakers, especially cabinet ministers, are not only responsible for making laws but also for running their ministries","\nSimilarly, being able to effectively manage TCs while performing our parliamentary roles such as debating legislation, proposing alternative policies, tabling amendments are part and parcel of our duties","\nManaging TCs will provide SDP MPs the necessary platform to excel in management and give the public confidence that we will be able to eventually takeover as government","\nDr Chee said"," “We welcome the challenge and are confident that we will surpass it","”\nMr John Tan presented some of the initiatives spelt out in the document, including how SDP will effect the transition from an outgoing PAP TC administration for the first 3

read all of the 39 pages of our climate change policy, here's a summary","\nWhat seems to be the problem and what's it to us?\nAs the climate change crisis confronting our planet deepens, Singapore will not be spared its consequences","\nWith rising global temperatures, polar ice-caps will melt and sea-levels will rise","\nThis will flood our coastal areas","\nIt will also heat up our island and cause health risks","\nSingapore is heating up twice as fast as other parts of the world","\nSuch a phenomenon will also wreak havoc with the weather in the region such as prolonged dry seasons and excessive rainfall","\nIt will adversely affect agriculture in our neighbouring countries on which much of our food supply depends","\nWarm sea temperatures will also cause marine life to die","All this will have a profound effect on food prices in Singapore - assuming that there is still enough food to go around","\n(SDP's Young Democrats launched the policy today","\nRead the report here or watch the event here",")\nSo what's causing the warming?\nThe cause of climate change is driven largely by the release of greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere primarily through the burning of fossil fuels (like oil and gas) to produce power that enables us to go about our daily lives (like driving and turning on the air-con)","\nThe burning of such fuels in Singapore through our oil refineries has made us a major emitter of greenhouse gases","\nIs the government doing anything about it?\nThe PAP's lack of decisive and expeditious action to arrest the problem means that Singapore is woefully underperforming when it comes to meeting emission-cutting targets required to slow down and reverse global warming","\nA group called The Climate Action Tracker monitors the progress that countries make in fighting climate change","\nIt ranks Singapore under the \"highly insufficient\" category","\nThe present arrangement is untenable and something needs to be done and done urgently if we want to leave the planet and our country habitable for future generations","\nSo what's the SDP's plan?\nBriefly, the SDP will"," 1","\nIncentivise and mandate motorists to switch to electric vehicles","\nTo achieve this, we will move to ramp up the installation of chargers needed for such vehicles across the island","\nThe target is to have 25 percent of cars on our roads be electric ones by 2030, 50 percent by 2040 and fully electrified by 2050","\n2","\nExpand our use of renewable energy, especially solar power","\nWith technology developing rapidly in harnessing clean energy, prices of electricity from such sources have tumbled making them viable alternatives to oil and gas","\nSDP will accelerate the installation of solar panels in public spaces, significantly increase R&D funding on solar projects, buy renewable energy from other countries, and collaborate with neighbouring countries to develop clean energy","\n3","\nRegulate the escalation of our population size","\nOur city is already one of the most densely populated spots in the world","\nWith the cramming of more and more people onto an already crowded island through an overly lax immigration policy, forests and nature reserves are being cleared and disturbed to make way for more construction for housing and transportation","\nThe loss of the island's \"lungs\" as well as our biodiversity is incalculable","4","\nFirmly enforce the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act by prosecuting business entities operating in Singapore that are linked with companies engaged in forest-burning in Indonesia","\n5","\nSignificantly upgrade Singapore's Nationally Determined Contributions that we signed under the Paris Agreement to lower and eventually remove harmful emissions","\n6","\nFinally, prohibit corporations from manufacturing products that depend on single-use packaging as well as inculcate among our people the desirable habit of recycling","\nBut didn't Minister Vivian Balakrishnan say that Singapore is a \"well-designed future-ready city\"?\nYes, but while the PAP talks a good game about taking action on climate change, evidence points to a lack of political will and urgency to ensure a future for Singapore that is smart, sustainable and green","\nIt continues to drag its feet over implementing pressing and meaningful measures to slow down and even reverse climate change","\nCase in point"," Climate Action Tracker's assessment","\nThis alternative policy is but the SDP's contribution to the on-going struggle to cultivate a Singapore that future generations can live in, free of the ravages of a planet destroyed by our greed and thoughtlessness","\nThe SDP calls on all Singaporeans, regardless of political persuasion and background, to

sacrifices of our people through the generations, and despite us rising from a Third World country to become a First World one, we are just an upgraded version of a sampan – “Sampan 2","0”","\nThis is very troubling!\nWhy?\nBecause a Sampan – regardless of whether it is an upgraded version or not – is only a one-man operated vehicle","\nThe ruling party asks the people for a strong mandate, they want Singaporeans to give them all the levers of control so that they alone can continue to operate Singapore and control Singaporeans in the manner they wish to","\nThey believe that only they have all the answers","\nThe political playing field continues to be further tilted to perpetuate a one-party dominance where systems are purposely kept weak","\nElection after election they ask for a strong mandate but once our people give it to them, we have seen them tinker not only with our lives and livelihoods but also with our Constitution","\nInstitutional safeguards are purposely left vague so as to give the PAP leaders enormous powers","\nThe Prevention from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) is a very good example of how much power they have given themselves – even to

absolute power corrupts absolutely","\n3","If a self-serving leadership were to appear, they would be unstoppable by the weak institutions we now have in Singapore","\nCAN WE CONTINUE TO REMAIN A

not forget that a sampan, even a Sampan 2","0 with the steadiest of hands, can only take its passengers that far","\nIn an increasingly globalised, competitive and fast-paced world, the challenges Singapore face have become more complex and multi-faceted","\nWith global uncertainties and with technology transforming and disrupting many industries with traditional jobs, Singapore is sailing through unchartered waters towards an uncertain future","\nWhen the world moves towards powerful zero-carbon ocean liners, we cannot remain a Sampan 2","0","\nWhile a sampan needs just one man to

capital owners at the expense of workers","\nWage redistribution policies are also skewed towards better educated top-earners","\n3","\nIn benchmarking their salaries to 60% of the median income of the top 1,000 earners who are citizens, the Government Ministers have chosen to identify themselves with the top earners","\nBecause their wages are pegged to the top earners, they have every

chairperson and Jurong GRC candidate, Michelle Lee (43) 15","ENSURING SINGAPORE IS READY FOR THE FUTURE SECTOR FOCUS"," SUPPORT FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES, INCREASING TOTAL FERTILITY RATE, CLIMATE CHANGE VALUES"," Fairness, Transparency, Happiness, Hope, Unity SUPPORT FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES 1","\nProvide priorities in government procurement for local businesses","\n2","\nUse Sovereign-Wealth Fund (SWF) to acquire companies in selected industries and reserving some jobs in these companies for Singaporeans to create opportunities for exposure, experience and training","\n3","\nProvide pathways for SMEs to partner GLCs/MNCs to venture overseas and provide risk capital in the form of debt instruments, quasi equity, and equity alongside technical assistance","\n4","\nStudy development of greater synergies with land-abundant neighbouring regions to support the whole value chain needs of businesses, thereby jointly offering investors a more attractive value proposition that spans borders","\n5","\nIdentify and better support local industries of growth with higher value","\n6","\nSupport the growth and development of local SMEs and move towards a more progressive tax structure","\nINCREASING TOTAL FERTILITY RATE 1","\nIncentivise workplaces to develop family-friendly policies","\nThese could be in the form of tax rebates, reliefs, priorities for leases and/or work permits or even awards","\n2","\nIncrease paid parental leave from the present 16+2 weeks to 6 months (26 weeks), of which at least 8 weeks need to be undertaken by either parent","\nSingle parents can enjoy the full 6 months paid parental leave","\n16","1","\nE 2"," e 3","\nEnsure that more flats are made available to young people in order to encourage early marriage and childbearing","\nThis could be done through lowering the age Singles could buy HDBs (from 35 to 30) and ensuring there are sufficient sales-for-balance flats (SBF) which could be bought by young couples ready to marry and possibly start a family early","\n4","\nOne of the largest opportunity costs for parents choosing to stay home in order to wholly care for and nurture their children is the loss of income and inability to build up their savings for their retirement","\nRecognition should be given to these parents for their contribution and commitment to bringing up the next generation of Singaporeans, and so the bare minimum could be for the state to make contributions to such caregivers’ CPF","\n5","\nPresently, infantcare and childcare subsidies are provided to parents only if the mother of the child is working","\nThis is one of the incentives for mothers to return to the workforce but also is yet another way to discriminate against parents to choose to stay home in order to nurture their children personally","\nIn order to provide all parents with equivalent options for preschool education, all parents should receive the same subsidies available to households with working mothers who send their children to childcare or infantcare centres for half day programmes","\nCLIMATE CHANGE 1","\nInvest in and Incentivise switch to clean energy","\nBesides exploring the feasibility of installing solar panels and wind turbines in public spaces, Singapore should also collaborate with the region in bringing clean solar and wind power to power the future Singapore","\n2","\nStudy the feasibility of renewable energy, but ensure that mega projects don’t create environmental problems","\nWe do have concerns about nuclear energy, especially with regards to safety issues","\nWe feel that solar energy could be more feasible","\n3","\nScale back the rapid pace of deforestation in Singapore and increase the pace of our program to plant trees back is sufficient to counter the effects of rapid deforestation","\n4","\nIncrease public education in the 3Rs “Reduce, Reuse and Recycle”","\n17","3","\n4","\n5","\nPush for a reduction of waste from households and businesses, implementing waste management schemes and sustainable neighbourhood recycling programmes","\n6","\nSupport the move towards more energy-efficient public transportation like electric vehicles","\n7","\nBetter

<h1>Concluding Thoughts</h1>
<p>Personally, this post reinforces a lot of my prior beliefs - that the PAP (understandably, as a function of an incumbent) spends less time championing topics related to <code>Civil Liberties</code> and <code>Governance</code>, that WP’s policies appear closer to the PAP’s than one might think, and <code>CPF/Housing</code>, <code>Labour</code> and <code>Social Mobility</code> issues appears to be what drives votes (since every party is heavily focused on them).</p>
<p>I’m also heartened that <code>Climate Change</code> is one of the topics that are already being discussed, as that could be one of the most defining issues of our generation. Within the <code>Others</code> category, I’m certain that there are important issues as well that have not been picked up by my filters e.g. minority rights, gender inequality, etc.</p>
<p>Collecting and cleaning the data took a surprisingly long time, but was ultimately rewarding seeing sentences being (mostly) correctly classified and learning about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode">unicodes</a> when struggling to separate bullet points. I suppose my experience does echo <a href="https://blog.ldodds.com/2020/01/31/do-data-scientists-spend-80-of-their-time-cleaning-data-turns-out-no/">surveys collected</a> on time spent cleaning data.</p>
<p>I look forward to casting my vote and if you are based in Singapore and eligible to vote, I hope you do too. Make your vote count!</p>
